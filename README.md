# This is collection of bits and pieces to build weeding bot. (or something)

Bot is build on frame of old lawn mover. Jetson Nano board handles communication with windows client. There is ZED-camera on board for images. Some custom PCB:s and China boards to contol motors.

Code is a mess, but it moves.. :-)
